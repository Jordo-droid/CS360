My work from CS-360 Mobile Architect &amp; Programming


    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    The requiremnets for this app were to create something capable of storing user input data into a database. There also needed to be functions for updating, deleting, and displaying the information to the user. I chose to develop a financial assistance application in the hopes of helping users with little to no experience budgeting gain a better graps on their finances.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    Touch Buttons are an absolute necessity when developing any mobile application. Esepcially with how prevalent Smart phones are today. Login screns are also a baseline addition to any mobile app, as they serve as not only a gateway, but a profile marker for storing variuos user data within the same application.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    References, especially the zyBooks chapters, were (as usual with CS courses) invaluable for the development and understanding of the app and the code behind it. I chose to take everything screen by screen and moved in a work flow that mirrors how users would use the application. I focused on the main functions for each screen first, before moving on to things that some users may overlook.
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    Running multiple build tests was an important step in making certain the application is functioning as designed. These tests not only reveal if your code is running, but they can often spot certain interactions that you may not account for when developing code.
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    The main point of innovation would be the actual structuring of the project, including it's UI design. One of the available options was an inventory app, which is what I chose. However, I took this in a less literal sense and tried to come up with an app that would act in the same manner as an inventory application would while also allowing me to create something a little different.
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    I think the overall hierarchical structure of the app was a success. The screens flow from one to the other, and I found a way to properly display the information from multiple screens/functions onto the main screen for ease of access/use for end users.
